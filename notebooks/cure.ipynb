    "For my project, I will be implementing the algorithm Clustering via Uncoupled REgression (CURE) from Wang's paper [Efficient Clustering for Stretched Mixtures: Landscape and Optimality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09960). CURE is an adaptation of binary logistic regression that uses clustering to predict labels for the data. "

    "### Motivation\n",
    "Many traditional clustering algorithms struggle to cluster elliptically distributed data. KNN, for example, assumes the data is spherically distributed and performs poorly when data is elliptically distributed. CURE seeks to solve this problem by creating a clustering algorithm that excels at clustering elliptically distributed data. My goal is to explicitly show that CURE outperforms KNN on elliptically distributed data."

    "We embed the data $\\boldsymbol{X}$ into 1D space via the dot product $x = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\boldsymbol{X_i}$. Then we plug $x$ into the discriminative function $f$ to separate, ie. discriminate, the embedded data into two clusters. How does this work? $f$ and $h$ both have minimums at both x=±1 so minimizing these equations will map many of our datapoints to x=1 and many of them to x=-1, resulting in two different clusters. Because $h$ becomes huge for large $x$ values ($h$ is quartic), we construct $f$ which is just like $h$ except that when $x$ is too big we clip its growth with linear functions. More explitically, $f$ has three parts. When $x$ is small, $|x| \\leq a$, we will minimize $h$ which has two valleys around ±1. When $x$ is too big, $|x| > b$, we will minimize a linear function so our values don't blow up. When $x$ is somewhere in between, $a < |x| \\leq b$, we use a cubic spline to connect the valleys to the linear function.\n",

    "So $ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f( \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\boldsymbol{X_i})$ embeds the data $\\boldsymbol{X}$ in 1D space and computes on average how well the data is separated into two clusters located at x=±1. The lower this value, the better. However, we can minimize this function by clustering all of the datapoints into a single cluster. To avoid this trivial solution, we use the penalty term $\\frac{1}{2} (\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu_0}})^2$. This term encourages the data $\\boldsymbol{X}$ to be evenly split between the two clusters at x=±1 as this term has the lowest value when $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu_0}} = 0$ which only occurs when the data is evenly split between both clusters. \n",

    "Putting it all together, the loss function embeds the data $\\boldsymbol{X} $ in 1D space and computes on average how well the data is separated into two evenly sized clusters located at x=±1.
